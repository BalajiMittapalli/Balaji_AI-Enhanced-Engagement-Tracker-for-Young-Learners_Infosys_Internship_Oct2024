__Image Processing:__

Image processing is a technique used to enhance, analyze, and manipulate digital images, typically through algorithms and computer vision tools. It involves a series of operations that transform an image to improve its quality, extract useful information, or prepare it for further analysis. Image processing has a wide array of applications, including photography, medical imaging, robotics, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles.

__Libraries or Frame works used - opencv__

__Version - 4.10.0.84__

__Developed Logics -__

__A. bgr2gray__

Converts a color image from BGR (Blue-Green-Red) to grayscale.

Grayscale images reduce memory usage and computational cost since they contain only intensity information.

Useful as a preprocessing step for many image processing algorithms, like edge detection and object tracking.

__B. blur__

Applies blurring to reduce image noise and smooth out details.

Common blurring techniques include Gaussian, median, and bilateral blurs.

Helps to remove small details, making it easier to detect larger features or objects.

__c. contour__

Detects and outlines the contours of objects within an image, often based on shape or intensity changes.
   
Useful for object recognition, shape analysis, and image segmentation.
   
Commonly used with thresholding or edge detection techniques to isolate contours.

__D. crop__

Extracts a specific region of interest (ROI) from the image.

Helps focus on relevant parts of the image and can improve computational efficiency.

Frequently used in facial recognition, object tracking, and image localization tasks.

__E. dil_ero__

Detects features and applies erosion to remove small noise or unwanted features.

Erosion reduces the thickness of object boundaries, which can be useful for separating close objects.

Often combined with dilation (another morphological operation) to refine object shapes.

__F. morphological_transformation__

Performs morphological transformations like dilation, erosion, opening, and closing.

Used for noise removal, enhancing object boundaries, and filling gaps.

Commonly applied after thresholding or edge detection for shape refinement.

__G. resize__

Changes the image dimensions while preserving or adjusting aspect ratio.

Important for preparing images for machine learning models that require fixed input sizes.

Can help balance image resolution with computational efficiency.

__H. rotate__

Rotates the image to a specified angle, either clockwise or counterclockwise.

Useful for correcting orientation or creating rotated data augmentations for models.

The rotation center and scale can be adjusted to control the rotation behavior.

__Output Image:__

__I. stack__

Combines multiple images into a single stacked format, often side-by-side or in a grid.

Useful for comparing processed images with the original or for creating multi-image displays.

Helps in visualizing step-by-step transformations in image processing.
